# Summer_Olympic_Analysis
In this repository I am analysis the Olympics data
### Libraries I am using in my project:
- **import pandas   :-** For reading the data set and used to get some insightful information.
- **import plotly.express   :-** There are many Python Data Visualization Libraries like matplotlib, ggplot, seaborn, plotly etc.. But plotly express is one of the best for graph visualization.
